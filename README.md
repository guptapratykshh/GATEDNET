# GatedNet 🏘️

A Hyperlocal MERN Stack Application for Gated Communities

## Overview

GatedNet is a modern web platform designed to streamline communication, management, and engagement within apartment societies and gated communities. It leverages geofencing, live polling, and collaborative tools to foster transparency, inclusivity, and efficient community operations.

## Problem Statement

Communication within gated communities often lacks efficiency, transparency, and inclusivity. Residents struggle to report issues, vote on community matters, or book shared amenities due to fragmented systems and outdated communication methods. This can lead to misunderstandings, disputes, and a lack of cohesive community management.
